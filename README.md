# go-guid
A webservice to compute W:ET GUIDs from etkeys

# download
Get pre-built binary here: https://drone.io/github.com/twcclan/go-guid/files

# getting started
The server is a single statically linked binary.
It will look for two environment variables:
* PORT (default=3000)
* HOST (default=)

So if started without any parameters, the server will attempt to listen on 0.0.0.0:3000

See https://github.com/twcclan/go-guid/blob/master/dist/upstart/guid.conf for an example Upstart configuration.

# performance / resource requirements 
(as tested on a small virtual machine, single 2 GHz Opteron core on Xen, 256 MB RAM)
The server uses about 1 KB of resident memory during normal operation, about half as much when idle.
Generating a single GUID takes about 10 Âµs, which in turn means the server mentioned above could generate about 100k GUIDs per second.
